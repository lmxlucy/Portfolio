                <p>TikTok has surged in popularity over the past few years. This success and engagement is in large part due to their mainstream introduction of an infinite scrolling user interface. This user interface has also been adopted by other large players,
                    such as Snapchat and Instagram, further demonstrating its effectiveness in engaging users. Learning that many people spending hours on these apps and feeling empty afterwards, we decided to take advantage of this infinite scrolling interface
                    to help users find a different type of content: fun facts.

                    <br>- 90.5% of users reported using social media to curb their boredom
                    <br>- 57.1% of users reported interests in learning new information/fun facts as an alternative and explained their reasons.

                <p>Our user tests focused on eight key functionalities of the app: creating an account, selecting categories (topics), setting up reminders, watching a topic specific feed, saving a fact, viewing another user’s profile, viewing tester’s personal
                    profile, and creating a fact. Users were asked to complete each of the eight tasks as we recorded their experience and feedback.

                <p>We adjusted our prototype according to the summarized feedback below.
                    <br>- Selecting categories interaction is confusing. Specifically, holding down larger categories to see subcategories was rarely accomplished.
                    <br>- Users did not want to opt out of reminders, but rather wanted to be prompted to opt in if they are interested.
                    <br>- Search icon for viewing topic specific feeds was misleading.
