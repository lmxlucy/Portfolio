# Meixuan Li's Portfolio
This is Meixuan Li's Portfolio. The purpose of this website is to provide professional information about myself and present a showcase of my work. The website has three sections: About, Work, and Journey. About gives a brief introduction to what I do professionally. Work showcases my projects with image previews and short descriptions. Journey presents a timeline of my professional activities in college.
