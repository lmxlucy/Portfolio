                <p>We conducted four generative competitive think-aloud studies on financial aspects of house buying. We used existing technology that help users make financially-sound decisions to learn about users and had each participant follow a series

                    <br> My team in this project was one of the best teams I have ever worked with. We worked closely together on every part of the project, so we were all on the same page. The work was evenly distributed and everyone was happy to take
                    on any extra work when necessary. We all took full responsibility for our own parts. I knew I got super lucky with this team and this seamless collaboration was one of a kind.
